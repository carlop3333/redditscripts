# A bunch of Node useless garbage
## Includes:
- Useless account creator (no seriously it doesn't work)
- Useless bot (not uploaded)
- Not so useless token getter
- Useless tor installer

# Requirements
- Obviously Node
- Firefox (for headless mode, required for creating accounts)

# Credits
[Josley88](https://github.com/Josley88) for helping in the code, fixing the tor installer and scrambling some shit from reddit (thank you, really)

[Nygosaki](https://github.com/Nygosaki) (aka Fishy) and [Kali](https://discord.com/user/964202096712880210) did the *Python* (oh yea) account creator, all this is pure **javascript** code, all the acc creator code will be continued in a private (and separate) repo, with a lot of overhauls

And finally, [aquakenzie](https://github.com/aquakenzie) for doing (and opensourcing) its own [repo](https://github.com/aquakenzie/2b2tplacergui), the placer's bot gui

I just did the old (outdated) acc creator in javascript, before moving to python (because of how bad selenium is in node), the token getting method, and just a tor installer (josley ended this one, ty)
